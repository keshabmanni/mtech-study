Welcome to your new TanStack Start app!

# Getting Started

```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Remove `@tailwindcss/vite` and `tailwindcss` from `package.json`


## Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

This project uses the Cloudflare Vite plugin (configured in `vite.config.ts`) and `wrangler.jsonc`:

1. Install Wrangler: `npm install -g wrangler`
2. Authenticate: `wrangler login`
3. Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

For production env vars, run `wrangler secret put MY_VAR` for each secret listed in `.env.example`. Public (non-secret) vars go in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars`.

KV, D1, and R2 bindings are configured in `wrangler.jsonc` — see https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/.

### Curriculum data

The home page loads subjects from the bound D1 database's `subjects` table through a server function. `mock-data/sem2_detailed.json` is seed/reference data, not a runtime dependency. The DDL and insert scripts in `sql_d1_schema/` define and populate the table.

### Temporary uploads

The `/upload` page stores anonymous uploads in the `mtech-study-files` folder in the `mtech-study-files` R2 bucket. `UPLOADS_MAX_FILES` in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars` sets the total number of unexpired files allowed in the folder and the maximum batch size; the upload page fetches this value from the server. Before each upload, the Worker counts unexpired R2 files and rejects a batch that would exceed the limit. This check does not serialize concurrent uploads, so simultaneous requests can exceed the configured limit. Create the bucket once before deploying:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create mtech-study-files
npm run cf-typegen
npm run deploy
```

The configured file limit applies to both the total unexpired files in the folder and the maximum files per upload batch. Each file has a 10 MB limit. The upload page fetches and displays every unexpired file in the R2 folder, including its unguessable download link. Anyone who can access the page can see the file names and links; anyone with a download link can access that file until it expires. Files are available for one hour. The Worker runs scheduled cleanup every ten minutes; expired downloads are rejected immediately, while object deletion may occur on the next cleanup run.

### Request rate limits

The Worker rate-limits requests per client IP: the home page allows 30 requests per 60 seconds, `POST /api/uploads` allows 10 requests per 60 seconds, and file downloads allow 30 requests per 60 seconds. Cloudflare's Rate Limiting API is approximate and tracks limits separately in each Cloudflare location.



## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])
  
  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).
